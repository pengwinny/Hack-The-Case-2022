# Hack-The-Case-2022: Amazon Green Initiative

Unlike most businesses, Amazon saw its sales and operations soar during the pandemic because of the world's reliance on quick, efficient, and easy online shopping. Amazon recorded a profit of over 200% in 2021 with statistics pointing to even greater growth in coming years. So how can Amazon find lateral opportunities to best invest its funds for long term profit? Amazon Prime: Eco Initiative aims to reclaim packaging materials and profit from an alternative income source by collaborating with recycling centers while also contributing to the United Nations' sustainability and development goals and creating a socially and environmentally positive brand image.

## Description

Amazon Green features a loyalty and reward program where customers can collect "leaves" for purchasing eco-friendly products. For every 1000 leaves, Amazon Green will plant a tree on behalf of the customer and to reward customers for making green choices, customers can redeem their leaves for exclusive discounts on their next purchase. To track their progress, customers have a virtual pet tree that they can view, which grows to reflect customers' eco-friendly choices and their progress towards planting another tree. Explore the tree icon in the top right corner and "purchase" products to see how the program works.

For every tree planted, a tree marker will appear on the map at the bottom of the page. For this particular initiative, we chose to focus on Yellowstone National Park and all trees will only be planted in the marked area (green circle).
